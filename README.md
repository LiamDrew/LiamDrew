Hi there!

Here are some of my projects, public and private.
### React
- **[Forge](https://github.com/LiamDrew/Forge)**: A prototype of a social goal-tracking web app I built using React. This app uses Redux to support efficient data management, enabling an extremely responsive user experience. The app uses a Firebase backend. I built the authentication system from scratch.

### C++
- Extensive experience using C++ for school projects. As part of the Data Structures (CS15) course at Tufts, all students build:
  - A metro simulator
  - A Reverse Polish notation calculator
  - A program to compress and decompress text using Huffman coding
  - A program allowing users to index and search through files, similar to the “grep” command in Unix

  I successfully implemented all of these projects to a very high standard. *(Repo is private to comply with Tufts policy).*

### C
- Experience programming in C as part of the Machine Structure and Assembly Language Programming (CS40) course at Tufts. Students implement:
  - A program to compress and decompress images
  - A Universal Machine (and profile it)
  - A variety of programs to process and modify images (uncorrupt images, remove black pixels from the edge of images, etc.)

  I successfully implemented all of these projects to a very high standard. *(Repo is private to comply with Tufts policy).*
