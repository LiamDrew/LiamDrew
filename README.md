Hi, I'm Liam. I'm a senior at Tufts studying Computer Science, and I'm seeking a full-time, in-person job starting in the summer of 2025.

I like building tools that help people solve problems.

I look for purpose through my work. I’m extremely invested in finding a company where I can take on responsibility and make a difference on an important project.

If you think I can make a difference on your team or at your company, please email me at [william.ward.drew@gmail.com](mailto:william.ward.drew@gmail.com).

## Fields of Interest
- **Industrial software**, particularly for agricultural or automotive applications
- **Finance**
- **Productivity and Task Management**

## Experience with Languages and Frameworks

### Python
- **Dark Arts Software (Summer 2024)**: I interned at Dark Arts Software, where I helped develop and test models that generate partner dancing motion. I worked with state-of-the-art motion generation methods (primarily Deep-Phase Neural Networks) using PyTorch, ONNX, and Unity. *(This is a proprietary project, so the repo is private).*
- **[VehicleMaintenance](https://github.com/LiamDrew/VehicleMaintenance)**: A tool I developed that helps business owners with specialty vehicles (farmers, business owners, etc.) stay up to date on their vehicle maintenance. I built a prototype using SQL, and refactored the tool using pandas and the pdflatex library to generate presentable reports for my users.
- **Machine Learning Course at Tufts**: I used logistic regression and BERT embeddings to classify text sentiment. I also used MLPs and CNNs to classify clothing images, using Scikit-learn and Keras. *(To comply with university policy, the repo is private).*
- **Computer Vision Course at Tufts**: I gained experience with pose estimation, feature detection, and image classification using CNNs, with cv2 and Scikit-learn. *(Repo is private to comply with Tufts policy).*

### React
- **[Forge](https://github.com/LiamDrew/Forge)**: A fully functional social goal-tracking web app I built using React. This app uses Redux to support efficient data management, enabling an extremely responsive user experience. The app uses a Firebase backend and has a fully functional authentication system that I built from scratch.

### C++
- Extensive experience using C++ for school projects. As part of the Data Structures (CS15) course at Tufts, all students build:
  - A metro simulator
  - A Reverse Polish notation calculator
  - A program to compress and decompress text using Huffman coding
  - A program allowing users to index and search through files, similar to the “grep” command in Unix

  I successfully implemented all of these projects to a very high standard, got an A in the course, and have TA’d this course since (and recently became a teaching fellow). *(Repo is private to comply with Tufts policy).*

### C
- Experience programming in C as part of the Machine Structure and Assembly Language Programming (CS40) course at Tufts. Students implement:
  - A program to compress and decompress images
  - A Universal Machine (and profile it)
  - A variety of programs to process and modify images (uncorrupt images, remove black pixels from the edge of images, etc.)

  I successfully implemented all of these projects to a very high standard and got an A in the course. *(Repo is private to comply with Tufts policy).*
