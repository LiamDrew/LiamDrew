Hi, I'm Liam. I'm a senior at Tufts studying Computer Science, and I'm seeking a full-time, (preferably) in-person job starting in the summer of 2025.

I like building tools that help people solve problems.

I‚Äôm interested in the following fields:
Industrial software, particularly for agricultural or automotive applications
Finance, particularly quant trading
Productivity and Task Management 


I‚Äôm skilled at developing software using the following languages and frameworks:
Python, particularly for Machine Learning applications.
I interned at Dark Arts Software during the summer of 2024. There, I helped develop and test models that generate partner dancing motion. I worked with state-of-the-art motion generation methods (primarily Deep-Phase Neural Networks) using PyTorch, ONNX, and Unity. (This is a proprietary project, so the repo is private).
VehicleMaintenance is a tool I developed that helps business owners with specialty vehicles (farmers, business owners, ect) stay up to date on their vehicle maintenance. I built a prototype using SQL, and refactored the tool using pandas and the pdflatex library to generate presentable reports for my users.
In a Machine Learning course at Tufts, I used logistic regression and BERT embeddings to classify text sentiment. I also used MLPs and CNNs to classify clothing images. I did this work with Scikit-learn and Keras. (To comply with university policy, the repo is private)
I‚Äôve also taken a Computer Vision course at Tufts, which gave me experience with pose estimation, feature detection, and image classification using CNNs (among other skills). I did this work with the cv2 library, as well as Scikit-learn. (Again, to comply with Tufts policy, this repo is private)
React
Forge is a fully functional social goal-tracking web app I built using React. This app uses Redux to support efficient data management, enabling an extremely responsive user experience. The app uses a Firebase backend and has a fully functional authentication system that I built from scratch.
C++
I have extensive experience using C++ for school projects. As part of the Data Structures (CS15) course at Tufts, all students build:
A metro simulator, 
a Reverse Polish notation calculator, 
a program to compress and decompress text using Huffman coding, 
A program allowing users to index and search through files, similar to the ‚Äúgrep‚Äù command in Unix
I successfully implemented all of these projects to a very high standard, and have TA‚Äôd this course since (and recently became a teaching fellow). (To comply with Tufts policy, this repo is private)
C
I also have plenty of experience programming in C. As part of the Machine Structure and Assembly Language Programming (CS40) course at Tufts, all students implement:
A program to compress and decompress images
A Universal Machine (and profile it)
A variety of programs to process and modify images (uncorrupt images, remove black pixels from the edge of images, ect.)
I successfully implemented all of these projects to a very high standard
With shell scripting and docker
I‚Äôm a teaching fellow for the Data Structures course at Tufts. My primary responsibility is to manage course infrastructure, which involves maintaining the software used to grade student assignments automatically. These responsibilities have given me experience working with docker and shell scripting, particularly with bash, while debugging issues

For more details regarding my work on projects that aren‚Äôt in public repos, please email me at william.ward.drew@gmail.com.

On a more personal note, I‚Äôm very much a live-to-work kind of person. I‚Äôm extremely invested in finding a company where I can take on responsibility and make a difference on an important project. 

If you think I can make a difference on your team or at your company, please reach out and let me know what I can do for you.
