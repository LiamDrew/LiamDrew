Hi there!

Here are some of my projects, public and private. For more details about my work on private projects, please email me at [william.ward.drew@gmail.com](mailto:william.ward.drew@gmail.com)

### Python
- **Dark Arts Software (Summer 2024)**: I interned at Dark Arts Software, where I helped develop and test models that generate partner dancing motion. I worked with state-of-the-art motion generation methods (primarily Deep-Phase Neural Networks) using PyTorch, ONNX, and Unity. *(This is a proprietary project, so the repo is private).*
- **[VehicleMaintenance](https://github.com/LiamDrew/VehicleMaintenance)**: A tool I developed that helps business owners with specialty vehicles (farmers, business owners, etc.) stay up to date on their vehicle maintenance. I built a prototype using SQL, and refactored the tool using pandas and the pdflatex library to generate presentable reports for my users.
- **Machine Learning (at Tufts)**: I used logistic regression and BERT embeddings to classify text sentiment. I also used MLPs and CNNs to classify clothing images, using Scikit-learn and Keras. *(To comply with university policy, the repo is private).*
- **Computer Vision (at Tufts)**: I gained experience with pose estimation, feature detection, and image classification using CNNs, with cv2 and Scikit-learn. *(Repo is private to comply with Tufts policy).*

### React
- **[Forge](https://github.com/LiamDrew/Forge)**: A fully functional social goal-tracking web app I built using React. This app uses Redux to support efficient data management, enabling an extremely responsive user experience. The app uses a Firebase backend. I built the authentication system from scratch.

### C++
- Extensive experience using C++ for school projects. As part of the Data Structures (CS15) course at Tufts, all students build:
  - A metro simulator
  - A Reverse Polish notation calculator
  - A program to compress and decompress text using Huffman coding
  - A program allowing users to index and search through files, similar to the “grep” command in Unix

  I successfully implemented all of these projects to a very high standard, got an A in the course, and have TA’d this course since (and recently became a teaching fellow). *(Repo is private to comply with Tufts policy).*

### C
- Experience programming in C as part of the Machine Structure and Assembly Language Programming (CS40) course at Tufts. Students implement:
  - A program to compress and decompress images
  - A Universal Machine (and profile it)
  - A variety of programs to process and modify images (uncorrupt images, remove black pixels from the edge of images, etc.)

  I successfully implemented all of these projects to a very high standard and got an A in the course. *(Repo is private to comply with Tufts policy).*
